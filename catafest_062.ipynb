            "3. **Roquefort**: A blue cheese made from sheep's milk, Roquefort is famous for its tangy, slightly salty flavor and its distinctive veins of blue mold.\n",

            "4. **Comté**: This hard cheese from the Jura region is known for its complex, nutty flavor and its versatility. It's often used in cooking and is a favorite for cheese plates.\n",

            "5. **Reblochon**: A soft, washed-rind and smear-ripened cheese from the Savoie region, Reblochon is known for its creamy texture and mild, slightly nutty flavor.\n",
            "\n",
